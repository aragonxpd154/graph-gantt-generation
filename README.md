The purpose of this project is to facilitate the visualization and monitoring of an activity schedule in a project. Through the graphical interface, users can add activities with their respective start and end dates, edit existing activities, delete activities, and view the updated Gantt chart. The project can be beneficial for project managers, academic personal projects, development teams, or anyone who needs to track and plan activities on a schedule.

## :rocket: Technologies

This project is still in the development stage and using the following technologies

- [Python3](https://www.python.org/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)

## :information_source: How To Use

To clone and download all project directories you can use [Git](https://git-scm.com), or any other specific program.

To clone the current directory use the command:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/aragonxpd154/graph-gantt-generation
```
Make sure that the file install_dependencies.sh has execution permissions. Otherwise, you can use the chmod command to grant the necessary permissions. For example:

```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the install_dependencies.sh file is located.

Execute the installation script using the following command:

```bash
./install_dependencies.sh
```
This will execute the script, which will update the repositories, install the necessary packages (such as Python 3, pip3, and matplotlib), and then run the specified Python script (replace "app.py" with the actual name of your Python script).

Make sure that the Python script file is in the same directory as the install_dependencies.sh file, or provide the full path to the Python script file in the execution command within the .sh file.

Note: Ensure that you have administrator privileges (sudo) to execute the installation commands in the install_dependencies.sh script in Linux.

## :information_source: About

This code aims to create a graphical interface for configuring and displaying a Gantt chart, facilitating the visualization and management of activity schedules in projects. Users can add, edit, and delete activities, view an updated Gantt chart, and benefit from its utility in project management and planning.

## â˜• Project Proposal

_Main features_
This code was developed with the purpose of creating a graphical interface for configuring and displaying a Gantt chart. The Gantt chart is commonly used to visualize the schedule of activities in projects, where each activity is represented by a horizontal bar indicating the time period during which the activity occurs.

The project proposed by this code allows the addition, editing, and deletion of activities through the graphical interface. The activities are stored in a list called "atividades" and can be viewed both in the Gantt chart and in a list within the window.

The interface utilizes the Tkinter library for creating the window and graphical elements such as labels, entry fields, and buttons. The matplotlib library is used to create and update the Gantt chart, while the csv library is used to save and load the activities from a .dat file.
